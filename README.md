For Autodesk Maya
It is python 2.7 because maya doesn't do python 3

I made this from the first couple weeks of classes. we learned some basic stuff.
This is before we learned about other basic shit like functions or loops and shit.
It is pretty long.
It is probably gross to look at but thats because we didn't learn a lot.
